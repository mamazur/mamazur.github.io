        <p class="container__desc-80">
          As a web developer I am very passionate about the collaboration with UX colleagues - building an application,
          I can not emphasize enough the difference between personal taste and researched based UX guidelines. Also, I
          strongly advocate for a proper use of tooling and a single source of truth approach. That is why I wanted to
          challenge myself to learn some Figma basics - as this is the current UX/UI tool of choice.
