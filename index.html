        I am currently working as a <span class="secondary-background"> software developer in a SCRUM team</span>
        responsible for digitalizing a lending process for business customers at one of the most renovated German banks.
        My team is developing an in-house cloud hosted <span class="secondary-background"> application</span>
        using mostly Vue.js and Java.
        <br>
        In the past few years I have worked mostly with dockerized application written in
        Node.js, Vue.js,
        Ruby on Rails and Elixir on AWS infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also gathered experience in large enterprise projects while working as

        <span class="secondary-background">technical consultant</span>
        in the area of customer communication services, as well as a development consultant for SAP
        projects
        creating custom tailored web based user portals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having worked for various companies with international teams have shown me a crucial
        importance
        of
        open and proactive communication for the successful completion of a project.
        In addition to technical knowledge, I consider myself to be a skilled <span
          class="secondary-background">communicator and collaborator</span>.
        I enjoy working closely with clients and team members to understand their needs and to develop custom solutions
        that meet their unique requirements, especially incorporating principles of Lean UX.

        <h3>SAP - Employee Portal</h3>
        <p>
          The employee portal is a concept that become popular mainly in large corporations - due to
          the high number of different IT systems and high demand for centralized information access.
          Here is an example of a project to deliver such a portal to the employees of an international corporation.

        <h3>Learn Figma basics</h3>
        <p>
          As a web developer I am very passionate about the collaboration with UX colleagues - building an application,
          I can not emphasize enough the difference between personal taste and researched based UX guidelines. Also, I
          strongly advocate for a proper use of tooling and a single source of truth approach. That is why I wanted to
          challenge myself to learn some Figma basics - as this is the current UX/UI tool of choice.
