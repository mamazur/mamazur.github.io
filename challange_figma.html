          The app in question was designed as a fair prototype. I took this opportunity to suggest  <span
            class="secondary-background">an app redesign
            focusing on controls usability.</span>  I tackled three main areas - focus on app functionality and hide the
          auxiliary
          information behind info buttons; make a clear distinction between action buttons; and finally, use proper
          controls for corresponding actions. e.g. to activate/deactivate a functionality, a toggle is the correct
          control (as an opposite to a button). Also, I have laid a focus on structuring and grouping input fields.

          Despite a live long passion for art and creative expression, I by no means consider myself a
          skilled UI/UX designer. My goal was to learn the Figma basic tooling and implement the
          learned material.

          During day to day collaboration with the UX designer on our team, I have learned, that <span
            class="secondary-background">grasping the concept of
            reusable components</span> seems to be the most challenging part for the UX designer without the computer
          science
          background. But as a person, who have spent a significant amount of time working with frameworks like Vue.js
          or
          Ruby on Rails or Phoenix I can hardly imagine the design process without them.
          Having familiarized myself with Figma basics, from designer perspective, have made my day-to-day work as
          a
          developer much easier.

    <p>
      Working in a realm of online advertising and domain parking, I was curious to find a cost-effective solution and a
      GPDR friendly alternative to such a website builder tools like WIX, Squarespace and/or IONOS.
      To my understanding, what most people want is a simple mobile friendly website with a clear stated information to
      advertise their business or personal brand. What they gob offered is usually suitable for a more high scaled
      business, with the downside of non-transparent hosting and data storage policy. My goal was to find an easy
      solution for this niche - with a <span class="secondary-background">cost-effective GDPR conform website</span>
      hosted in Germany and no Google Analytics tools
      involved.
