                    <p>II am currently working as a software developer in a SCRUM team responsible for online
                        advertising
                        platform solution. Team is developing an in-house cloud hosted applications using node.js and
                        Elixir. In the past few years I have worked mostly with dockerized application written in
                        Node.js,
                        Ruby on Rails, Vue.js and Elixir on AWS infrustructure. </p>

                        consultant
                        in the area of customer communication services, as well as a development consultant for SAP
                        projects

                        of
                        open and proactive communication for the successful completion of a project.</p>
