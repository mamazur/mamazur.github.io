      <div class="container__desc-50">
        <p>
          The goal of the project was to generate travel documents - airplain and train tickets, hotel reservations,
          information brochures etc.
          and distribute these documents to the customer - via email (Part I) and via post (Part II).
        </p>

        <p> We developed a project in the following directions:<span class="secondary-background"> reduce the
            cost</span> compared to competitor's system;
          transfere responsibility for system maintenance from IT staff to customer support staff;
          <span class="secondary-background"> minimize development cycle</span> of the customer communication
          documents

    <h3 class="margin-5rem-t">Project Scope </h3>
    <p>
      Before my team started the project implementation, multiple meetings between the customer side and my
      colleagues from pre-sales took place, to ensure that the declared functionality of the product met the
      requirements of the customer.</p>
    <p>
      The work had to be carried out in the following steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Installation and configuration of programs and deployment of infrastructure on the customer's servers (two
        environments - dev and prod, using Windows operating system and Microsoft SQL each )</li>
      <li> The visual design of the documents</li>
      <li>Setting up a text store and rules for the automated customer interaction</li>
      <li>Educate customer support stuff on system usage and maintenance</li>
      <li>Get ready for the second part of the project - generating the printed media </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lessons Learned:</h3>
    <p>As it was the first big enterprise project I participated in - I could gather some useful input for my future
      career.

    <ul>
      <li>One of the important aspects was the usage of <span class="secondary-background"> waterfall</span> model for
        project management and planing.
        This setup lead to classical problems including <span class="secondary-background"> too long iteration, lack of
          timely feedback and not meeting
          the deadline.</span> </li>
      <li>Also I could observe some consulting specific problems like the not sufficiently trained stuff and
        overselling. The money paid for consulting does not guarantee results when the consultant does not have the
        time and opportunity to work into the new system.</li>
      <li>During the pre-sales demo, one tend to sell
        more comfort than they could actually provide and overestimate the technical skills of the
        customer service employees.</li>
      <li>Some minor issues included the lack of automated testing and version control system.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="secondary-background"> The rather
        conservative management structure </span> on the project lead to an interesting phenomenon,
      there were <span class="secondary-background"> too many responsible
        departments and a lot of micromanagement overhead. </span>
      Up to 2/3 of the project, there was no dedicated person responsible for
      the entire project, which was critical considering the number of project participants and contractors.

      What I learned
      is that it is very difficult to explain to the customer the difference between visualization and technical
      realization. It's easy enough to create a document that looks like it's 80 percent complete. It is very
      difficult to find the level of abstraction that will be understood by all parties.
    </p>
    <p> What is intuitive and understandable for one category of specialists may not be intuitive for the other.
      Misunderstanding does not indicate a low degree of skill sets. The seminar for consultants helped
      me understand, the dangers of being biased towards clients who do not have the same level of
      technical training.</p>
    <p> An interesting aspect - was to get rid of the legacy system, and to solve tasks that were considered
      unsolvable. We were lucky <span class="secondary-background"> to avoid the classical problem - that the new system
        should copy the old one. </span>
      It was
      an interesting task from an analytical
      and communication point of view. </p>
    <p>
      With different management structure the project could have been implemented with less time money, effort and
      stress. When too many different departments of the company are
      involved, when each department of the company reports on the piece of work - but in the absence of
      interaction between departments and integration of the completed parts -
      every single result is useless. Lack of coordination is as bad as not completing a task on time, and
      completing a subtask on time, does not guarantee the success of your project.</p>


    <h3>What are travel documents? </h3>
    <p>
      When a person or a company books a trip or hotel - the travel documents are issued -
      including a flight tickets, a hotel voucher, occasionally transfer documents for a trip from the
      airport to the hotel or
      train tickets. </p>
    <p>
      The user receives a full set of documents through one of the selected channels -
      Email or mail. The user is also provided with information about the legal requirements in the country of
      arrival, data on vaccination and medical insurance, as well as information about the culture and customs
      of the country, such as the working hours of restaurants, the amount of the tip or the crime situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      StreamServe systems cover exactly these demands - generating documents from structured data (e.g. XML) and
      distributing documents to end users through the specified channels.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the documents were not generated correctly or the end user has questions, the support service should
      have access to the already sent documents, as well as be able to correct the error or resend the
      documents. And just as it was already mentioned above, the cycle of development and implementation of new
      documents should have been minimized.</p>
    <p>
      The documents themselves were generated depending on some factors, such as the type of trip, the
      country, the scope of services, the chosen language for the documents, as well as the brand under which
      the reservation was made. Since it was a large tourist conglomerate, the parent concern included several
      brands whose documents differed in type and volume of information.</p>

    <h3>Project walk through </h3>
    <p>
      The first thing to do was to configure the necessary infrastructure for generating and sending documents
      via email (email body and attachments).
      All document types but one - train tickets generated by Deutsche Bahn IT and retrieved directly from FTP
      Server - were generated by StreamServe directly.
    </p>
    <div class="container__flex">
      <a href="https://irena-mazur.de/" target="_blank">
        <img src="./img/projects/tc_2.png" style="padding:1rem;">
      </a>
    </div>
    At these stage, we could define main challenges:
    <ul>
      <li>Different brands</li>
      <li>Huge amount of personalized texts</li>
      <li>Minimized development cycle of documents</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The documents themselves were made in StreamServe Story Teller, a WYSIWYG editor that works with XML data
      (at least at that time). The texts were stored and processed in a web application called Content Center.
    </p>

    <p> The work was carried out simultaneously in two directions - a requirement analysis of all cases was
      made from the customer support point of view.
      We needed to achieve an understanding on how the data is visualized on travel documents and what data
      structure adjustments are required.
      I have worked closely with customer support employees and therefore was able to establish a semi-iterative
      process.
    </p>
    <p>In parallel, we are working with texts - the legacy system for text maintenance was written in the
      COBOL language.

      Since we were talking about a legacy system, the data was stored
      in a data structure - with numerous if statements - and each
      statement represented one rule to locate the text. If it was necessary to change or expand the rule by which
      the text was displayed, very
      often a new query branch was simply added, and the text was duplicated. As the result, the
      number of rules was five times higher than the number of unique texts.</p>
    <p>The first task was to consolidate all the rules and texts.
      Secondly,
      we had to transform the rules from a colloquial form, into rules that followed the
      Boolean logic to correspond with SQL statements on a DB level.</p>
    <p>The Content Center provided the ability to create rules using a less technical pseudo language, the Low
      Code System. I have observed this pattern in other projects as well - I find this approach very
      counterintuitive.
      An
      abstract pseudo language is generally conceived as simple and intuitive, but ceases to be so very quickly
      due to the complexity of the systems for which it is developed. And in place of the promised simplicity,
      we get queries that are not inferior in complexity to native queries written in SQL, but at the same time
      we get an additional application layer that is also prone to programming errors.</p>


    <p>After the technical problems were solved, most of the work was occupied by teaching employees on a
      customers
      side how to use the system.</p>
